## Overview

This repository houses the source code for the [Cozyhive] Discord bot, which has the responsibility of syncing boosts across the multiple Discord servers, amongst other things.

---

### Local setup

This setup assumes you have [Git], and [Node.js] setup on your machine. This repository requires [Node.js] version 20 or higher, and uses the [pnpm] package manager, so you should have basic knowledge about how to use them.

#### Cloning repository

- `git clone git@github.com:almeidx/cozyhive-bot.git`
- `cd cozyhive-bot`
- `pnpm i`

Note: If you don't have corepack enabled, you can do it with `corepack enable`.

#### Running the bot locally

- `pnpm build`

Then:

- if you're using pm2, you can use:
  - `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`

- if your environment variables are stored on the .env file, you can use:
  - `pnpm start:env`

- otherwise, use:
  - `pnpm start`
