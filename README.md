## Overview

This repository houses the source code for the [Cozyhive] Discord bot, which has the responsibility of syncing boosts
across the multiple Discord servers, amongst other things.

---

### Local setup

This setup assumes you have [Git], and [Node.js] setup on your machine. This repository requires [Node.js] version 22 or
higher, and uses the [pnpm] package manager, so you should have basic knowledge about how to use them.

#### Cloning repository

- `git clone git@github.com:almeidx/cozyhive-bot.git`
- `cd cozyhive-bot`
- `corepack install`
- `pnpm i`

Note: If you don't have corepack enabled, you can do it with `corepack enable`.

#### Running the bot locally

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values. Make sure to keep the `NODE_OPTIONS` value as it
is.

- `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs`
